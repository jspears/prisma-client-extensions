# Prisma Client Extension - `upsertFirst`

This example demonstrates how to create a Prisma Client extension that adds virtual / computed fields to a Prisma model. These fields are not included in the database, but rather are computed at runtime.

Computed fields are type-safe and may return anything from simple values to complex objects, or even functions that can act as methods for your models.

Computed fields must specify which other fields they depend on, and they may be composed / reused by other computed fields.

## Caveats

Prisma Client extensions are currently in developer preview. This extension is provided as an example only. It is not intended to be used in production environments.

Please read [the documentation on `result` extensions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/result) for more information.
